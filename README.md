# APHRC-LSHTM-IDSR-Project
**Disambiguation**: *See [this GitHub](https://github.com/tathagatabhattacharjee/Generic-IDSR-COVID-19-data-to-OMOP-6.0-under-INSPIRE-Project) for the project that creates synthetic IDSR data and ETLs it into an OMOP CDM. And see [this GitHub](https://github.com/jaygee-on-github/INSPIRE-Domain-Model-for-Network-Cohort-Studies) for a description of the model we populate with structured metadata that gets shared across sites in a network MedicalObservationalStudy. Alternatively, the APHRC-LSHTM-IDSR-Project is analysis-oriented: it runs MedicalObservationalStudy specifications through one or more data analysis workbenches.*
