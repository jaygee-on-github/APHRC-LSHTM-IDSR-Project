# The APHRC-LSHTM-MUBAS IDSR Project
**Disambiguation**: *See [this GitHub](https://github.com/tathagatabhattacharjee/Generic-IDSR-COVID-19-data-to-OMOP-6.0-under-INSPIRE-Project) for a project that creates synthetic IDSR data and ETLs it into an OMOP CDM. See [this GitHub](https://github.com/Inspire-Mubas) for a companion project that creates synthetic IDSR data and ETLs it into yet another OMOP CDM. And see [this GitHub](https://github.com/jaygee-on-github/INSPIRE-Domain-Model-for-Network-Cohort-Studies) for a description of the model we populate with structured metadata that gets shared across sites in a network MedicalObservationalStudy. Alternatively, the APHRC-LSHTM-MUBAS-IDSR-Project is analysis-oriented: it instantiates a MedicalObservationalStudy and specializes it to run with one or more data analysis workbenches in play in a network study.*

This project is still in play and has spawned several studies. Each MedicalObservationalStudy the project spawns has its own [Wiki](https://github.com/jaygee-on-github/The-APHRC-LSHTM-MUBAS-IDSR-Project/wiki) page.
